# ðŸ‘‹ Welcome!

Welcome to LineNumbers! It's a library that gets line numbers from the solution file and gets how many lines did the program take (excluding the generated files)

To use this library, go to any page in the left side of the screen.

## Installation

This library is very easy to install. It's available at [NuGet](https://www.nuget.org/packages/LineNumbers.Core/). Just follow these steps:

1. Open your project file (`.csproj` or `.fsproj`)
2. Place the `PackageReference` line on a property group like so:
   * `<PackageReference Include="LineNumbers.Core" Version="x.x.x" />`
   * ...where `Version` is the current version of the library
3. Run a package restore using `dotnet restore`

If you follow these steps correctly, you should be able to use LineNumbers's functions.
